\title{Soil macrofauna in a tropical forest site before and after deforestation (traditional slash-and-burn, Elahe, French Guiana) }
\usage{
  data(efeb)
}
\description{
  The \code{efeb} data set is a list of two data sets. Each one is a data frame giving the species abundance of soil macrofauna in a set of soil samples.  \code{efeb$ef} corresponds to samples collected in a secondary forest in French Guiana while \code{efeb$eb} contains data collected in the same site just after the forest has been cut and burnt following the traditional Amerindian slash-and-burn system. These data were collected in the viciny of the Wayana village of Elahe situated on the Tampoc river.
